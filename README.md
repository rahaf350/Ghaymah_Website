With the Corona pandemic spreading, many of us are spending a lot of time using phones and
computers. The wrong use may be detrimental to children, and in this sense, we have considered the
creation of an educational site for children, aimed at educating them amusingly in several areas where
the child can choose what is appropriate to his interest. The idea of an educational site is in the field
of human-computer interaction, where we will use visual and audible communication that will help a
child interact with the site through a user experience suitable for children
